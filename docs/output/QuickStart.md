# Quick Start

This is a simple quick start guide how to clone my project and get it running.

1. You can clone the code with this command:

```bash
git clone --recursive --submodules https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/GE/Teaching/gl3/projects/2024/05-gl3-kalb.git
```

2. Once cloned, you can open the code folder in CLion. And load the `CMakeLists.txt` file (CMake vers. 3.29 or higher is required).

3. In CLion go to Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Toolchanins add the Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler (2019 or 2022) and hit Apply

4. You should now have a running configuration -> compile the code and have fun!
