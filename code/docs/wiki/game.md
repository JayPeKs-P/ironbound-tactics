# How to play

## Core Concept
When you start the game, you will see a menu with three sliders. On the top of that menu is a number. 
This number represents the total amount of **Commandpoints** you (the player) have available.  
At the moment there are three different types of units: Infantry, Archers and Catapults. You are
free to select how many units of each type you want to add to your army, mind however that units 
can have different costs.

### Price of each Unit Type

|Unit Type | Cost |    
|----------|------|
 |Infantry | 1 CP |
| Archer | 1CP | 
| Catapult | 5CP |

### Combat
When you are happy with the distribution in your army click accept. A countdown will show up and the 
firs round of combat will begin. On the left side are your units, on the right those of your opponent.

`Left Click` on any unit type to see their individual attributes.  
`Left Click` your units and then `Left Click` again any of your opponent to select how many of them
should attack.  
`Right Click` to unselect.  

**Catapults** can not attack until you send some of your **Infantry** units to use them. To do this  
`Left Click` your **Infantry** units and then `Left Click` again your **Catapult** units.

As mentioned before units have different attributes. Two very important values are **Accuracy** and 
**Attack Speed**. **Catapults** for example have lower accuracy then **Archers** and **Infantry**,
to balance this they deal a lot more damage and have a higher **Crit Value**.  
At first glance this might give them a big advantage over the rest of the units, but compared to 
**Archers** who have a **Speed value** of 1, **Catapults** only have a **Speed Value** of 3. This 
means that **Archers** will attack their target at the end of the turn you told them to, whereas 
**Catapults** will attack at the end of third from last turn.

When you manage to defeat all your opponents units the next round starts automatically.
