## Abstract
As part of the module *GameLab III*, which is one of the core modules of the bachelors degree *Games Engineering* at Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg, students are tasked to develop a videogame in *C++* without using existing engines or engine-like
libraries.
`Ironbound Tactics` is the game I create in course of this module. It is a turn based endless battler, where the player creates an army by picking their units out of a set pool and then fights the armies of random computer controlled opponents.
**This project is still Work In Progress as of

## Usage
A playable build of the game is located in `root/builds`.  To compile the source code clone the repository. **This project has several external dependencies which are embedded as submodules**. To minimize the risk of compilation issues use:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JayPeKs-P/ironbound-tactics
```


To compile the source code use the [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) compiler and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) **version 3.29** or higher. Select the `root/code` folder as the project root folder in your IDE.
> [!CAUTION] 
> **MSVC Compiler is required**
> This project uses an implementation of the SoLoud library, that **requires** the MSVC compiler. Should you encounter any problems, make sure it is properly set up. (In CLion make sure it is the first entry in the list of compilers in
>  `Settings / Build, Execution, Deployment / Toolchains`)

I built this project in the IDE [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) from jetbrains.

## Repository Usage Guides
IMPORTANT: This project uses submodules. Use `git clone --recurse-submodules <...>` when cloning. 
Also this project requires **CMake 3.29** as minimum. Should it not be possible, for whatever reason, to use this version or newer, change `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28.1)` in engine/CMakeLists.txt and root CMakeLists.txt.
